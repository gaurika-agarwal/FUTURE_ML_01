Sales & Demand Forecasting for Businesses

Business Insight

The forecasting model predicts future daily sales based on historical patterns.
Businesses can use these predictions to plan inventory, manage staffing, and avoid overstocking or stock shortages.
Understanding sales trends helps organizations make better operational and financial decisions.

This project is part of the Machine Learning Internship at Future Interns.
